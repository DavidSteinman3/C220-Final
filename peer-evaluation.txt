What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

How one can use the green color ‘control’ nodes to create a chance game using a random number generator

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

The game reflects the theme because it is focused on the federal reserve distributing checks as a result of the virus impact on the American economy and businesses.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

I liked how the group utilized random numbers. Our group just made a shooter game but I believe that the games with chance can be very fun to play.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

Having clearer instructions would definitely make the goal of the game easier to understand. I didn’t know the premise of the game just by loading it up, I had to take a look at the script.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

The entire GDScript was a bit confusing, there were so many lines that I thought Godot had utilized some kind of WET coding instead of DRY.

Is it clear that every group member participated?

Griffin Morrison seems to have done a bigger portion of the work, but it is not clear or evident that any specific group members didn’t pull their weight.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Clear instructions and the point/goal of the game overall.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

This game is very unique and unlike any of the projects we have done throughout this semester.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?

Full points for creativity
